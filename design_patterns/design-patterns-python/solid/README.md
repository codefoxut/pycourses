- **Solid Principles:**
    1. **Single Responsibility Principle:** 
        1. A class should only have one reason to change.
        2. Separation of concerns: different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.
    2. **Open-Closed Principle:**
        1. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    3. **Liskov Substitution Principle:**
        1. You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
    4. **Interface Segregation Principle:**
        1. Don’t put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces.
        2. YAGNI: You Ain’t Going to Need It.
    5. **Dependency Inversion Principle:**
        1. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; 
        2. use abstractions;
