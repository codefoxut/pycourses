An interesting fact about Mars is that it has the largest volcano and the deepest, longest canyon in the solar system. The volcano is named Olympus Mons and stands about 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) high, which is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest, Earth's tallest mountain above sea level. The canyon, known as Valles Marineris, is over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) long and can go as deep as 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) in some places, which is about four times as long and four times as deep as the Grand Canyon in the United States. Mars also has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.\n"

You might want to have dinner at one of the restaurants within the park, like The Commissary or Arguello.\\n\\n**Day 5: Relaxation and Views**\\n- Spend your last morning relaxing at the Japanese Tea Garden or the San Francisco Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park.\\n- Have a leisurely lunch in the Inner Sunset district, which offers diverse cuisine options.\\n- For your final afternoon, take a trip to Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill for panoramic views of the city.\\n- Enjoy your last dinner at a restaurant with a view, maybe in the Cliff House, to look out over the Pacific Ocean as the sun sets.\\n\\nRemember to book accommodations well in advance, as the city can get quite busy, especially during the summer months. Also, be prepared for the weather, which can be quite cool and foggy even in the summer; layers are your friend in San Francisco!\\n\\nThis itinerary is just a starting point, and there's so much more to see and do in San Francisco depending on your interests, from the Exploratorium for science fans to the bustling Chinatown, the oldest in North America. Enjoy your trip!\"}"
